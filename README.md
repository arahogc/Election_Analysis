3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Election Audit Summary 
While this script was very useful to analyze the amount of votes that were cast and who had won, the code could be modified to provide more information. The first parameter could be the turn out of voters. For example, overall there could be a total amount of registered voters in race, which then could be broken down per county. This could be useful to see how many people are turning out to vote which could be useful for campaiging efforts to get more people out to vote. The second parameter could be how the votes were submiteed, e.g. the amount of votes cast by mail vs in person. This could also be useful to understand how people are voting, which could be useful to individual counties as well as the state government.
